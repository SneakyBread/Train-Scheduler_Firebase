# Train-Scheduler_Firebase

#### This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. It utilizes the JavaScript library, Moment.js, to manage dates/times. It also provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

#### Add any train name and its information (destination, first train time, and frequency of arrival) to the scheduler!
